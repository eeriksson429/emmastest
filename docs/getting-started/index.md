# Getting Started

## For who?

The Widget SDK is aimed at web developers who have knowledge about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We recommend inline widgets to be built using TypeScript + Angular (2.x), as these techniques are used for the Homepages framework and application.

## What's Included

The Widget SDK zip file includes documentation (Developer's Guide and a Framework API reference), source code, Widget samples project and a simple NodeJS server to run the samples on if not using the included Visual Studio solution. The latest Widget SDK deliverable can be found [here](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk).
