# Getting Started

## For who?

The Widget SDK is aimed at web developers who have knowledge about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We recommend inline widgets to be built using TypeScript + Angular (2.x), as these techniques are used for the Homepages framework and application.

## What's Included

The Widget SDK zip file includes documentation (Developer's Guide and a Framework API reference), source code, Widget samples project and a simple NodeJS server to run the samples on if not using the included Visual Studio solution. The latest Widget SDK deliverable can be found [here](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk).

## Dependencies
To use all parts of the Homepages Widget SDK you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a [TypeScript compiler](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and an [Integrated development environment or a Text Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

This section briefly describes how to quick start your widget development using the Homepages Widget SDK. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk/blob/master/DevelopersGuide.pdf).
