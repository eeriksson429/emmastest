# Best Practices
{: .no_toc }

Here are some best practices to consider when building your widgets. For further reading, please refer to the [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk/blob/master/DevelopersGuide.pdf).

## Develop for speed

When it comes to user experience, speed matters. As a site begins to load, there's a period of time where users wait for content to appear. In the case of Homepages, the user might have 10 widgets on a normal page that has to load data and these widgets are all competing for a limited set of resources. In addition, more users are accessing through mobile devices with limited CPU power and memory as well as less bandwidth speed. 

Here are some points to consider when developing your widget with performance in mind: 

* Use ION APIs to communicate with the backend, for example when retrieving data, or creating / updating / deleting data
* Make sure that the initial number of requests without user interaction are as few as possible
* Make sure that the APIs you plan to use or develop perform in a timely manner as the browser can only have a fixed set of requests in parallel
* Only load 10-15 items in a list with an option to load more on user activity
* Paging should be done on the server
* Use AoT instead of Jit

## Use IDS Enterprise component library
When designing your widget, we strongly recommend using the [IDS Enterprise Components](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise) for the UI. 

![Screenshot of a IDS homepage](../assets/images/ids-screenshot.png)

The IDS Enterprise Components is a framework-independent UI component library built in js and css that is pattern-focused, template-driven, touch-enabled, responsive, accessible, and themable.

Complex custom components should always be avoided. If custom styling or components has been used, they must follow the IDS guidelines for look & feel, theming, mobile and accessibility support.

* [IDS Enterprise Components](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise)

## Theme Support
Widgets should support the three theme variants of the IDS Subtle Theme; Light, Dark and High Contrast.

The IDS Enterprise components automatically supports all theme variants. 

If custom styling or components has been used, those must align with the IDS look & feel for each theme variant.

## Translate your widgets
We recommend that you translate your widgets so that they support the same languages as supported by Infor OS. For a current list of supported languages, see [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk/blob/master/DevelopersGuide.pdf).

Add translations using the `localization` property in the widget manifest.

### Example
{: .no_toc }
```
"localization": { 
    "en-US": { 
        "widgetTitle": "Hello World", 
        "widgetDescription": "Hello World Sample Widget." 
    } 
}
```

## Design for all widget sizes 
A widget can be used on a page in 8 different sizes (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3 and 2x4). Your widget should be runnable in all of these, meaning that all components should be visible and usable. 

![Screenshot of a homepage with widgets](../assets/images/homepages_widget-sizes.png)

Consider optimizing your widget for all widget sizes, by for example showing additional content when the widget is larger than 1x1, or adjusting margins, paddings and/or graphic elements when the widget is smaller to make your widget more efficient.

## Add widget screenshots
You can add up to three PNG image files that will be shown when viewing the widget in the Widget Catalog. The screenshots helps communicate the widget's features and visual experience for your end users. 

![Screenshot of Widget Catalog](../assets/images/widget-catalog_screenshots-example.png)

Configure your screenshots by adding up to three PNG image files in the widget ZIP. 

The screenshots must be named `screenshot1.png` `screenshot2.png` etc. The image will be displayed in a 200x200px container, and if the image is clicked the image is shown in its original size.

Reference the images using the `screenshots` property in the widget manifest. The value should reflect the number of screenshots. 

### Example
{: .no_toc }
```
"screenshots": "2" 
```

## Enable your widgets for Infor Go 
Allow your users to access your widget from the Infor Go mobile application for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infor.go&hl=en) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/bs/app/infor-go/id1446388736). When running on a mobile device the widget can access native device features like GPS information and camera.

Enable your widget for Infor Go by setting the `target` property in the widget manifest to `mobile`.

### Example
{: .no_toc }
```
"target": "mobile"
```

## Build your widgets for the banner area
A Banner widget is a widget that can be added to the banner container. The banner container is located at the top of the page directly below the page header, and always spans the entire first row. It holds between one and four banner widgets and has a background color based on the color of the page.

![Screenshot of a homepage with widgets](../assets/images/homepages-screenshot.png)

Enable your widget for the banner area by setting the `target` property in the widget manifest to `banner`.

### Example
{: .no_toc }
```
"target": "banner"
```

## Configure a Help URL 
Give your users some help along the way by providing a link to documentation for your widget. The link will be displayed for end users in the About dialog. 

Configure the link by adding the `helpUrl` property in the widget manifest. 

### Examples
{: .no_toc }
```
"helpUrl": "http://www.example.com/" 
"helpUrl": "{Scheme}://{Hostname}:{Port}/{TenantId}/MyApp/Help"
```
