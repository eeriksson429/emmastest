# Introduction

The Widget SDK is used to build widgets for [Infor Homepages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP7f6T442JY).

## What is a widget?
A widget can be defined as a small, single-purpose application that provides quick, at-a-glance information or quick access to simple interactive functions. Widgets are simpler and faster to access than full applications (apps) that may provide more functionality.

Homepages may contain one or many pages and each page may contain one or many widgets. Widgets can be added to a page from the Widget Catalog.

### Banner Widgets 
A banner widget is a special widget that is added to the banner container. The banner container is located at the top of the page directly below the page header, and always spans the first row. 

### Mobile Widgets
A Mobile widget is a widget that is built for the Infor Go mobile application for Android and IOS. When running on a mobile device the widget can access native device features like GPS information and camera.

### Tenant Widgets
A tenant widget is a widget developed by a partner or customer of Infor. Tenant widgets can be uploaded and installed in an cloud environment via the Homepages Administration Tool.
