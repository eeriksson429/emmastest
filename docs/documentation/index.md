# Documentation

The Widget SDK is used to build widgets for Homepages in Infor Ming.le.

This section includes a brief introduction to the Homepages Widget SDK. For the full documentation, please refer to the [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk/blob/master/DevelopersGuide.pdf).

## What is a widget? 
A widget can be defined as a small, single-purpose application that provides quick, at-a-glance information or quick access to simple interactive functions. Widgets are simpler and faster to access than full applications (apps) that may provide more functionality.

Homepages may contain one or many pages and each page may contain one or many widgets. Widgets can be added to a page from the Widget Catalog.

## Technologies 
The Homepages framework is implemented using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and the [Enterprise Components for Infor Design System](https://design.infor.com/code/ids-enterprise/latest/index). A widget may be implemented using these technologies as well but TypeScript and Angular are completely optional.

Widgets should use the Enterprise Components for Infor Design System or follow Infor design guidelines.
