# Documentation

The Homepages Widget SDK is used to build widgets for Infor Homepages.

## What is a widget? 
A widget can be defined as a small, single-purpose application that provides quick, at-a-glance information or quick access to simple interactive functions. Widgets are simpler and faster to access than full applications (apps) that may provide more functionality.

Homepages may contain one or many pages and each page may contain one or many widgets. Widgets can be added to a page from the Widget Catalog.

## About this documentation
