## The What and The Why
XtendM3 is an extensibility tool targeted for modifying and extending M3 Business in M3 Cloud Edition. For M3 there are 
different extensibility tools e.g. Mongoose, H5 Script, H5 SDK, etc. but the lack of capabilities for changing the 
business engine logic at realtime was the motivation to create another extensibility tool where realtime modification or 
extension of the logic is possible.
